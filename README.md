# Wikimedia-RecSys

This repository contains the code necesarry for:

- Extracting image features using a pre-trained EfficientNet (EfficientNet.ipynb)
- Predict Image quality using a pre-trained model (QualityPredictor.ipynb)
- Make recommendations based on both plain Collaborative Filtering and a mix of CF and image features (Reccomendations.ipynb)

These notebooks are made to run in a Google Collab Environment, but can be easily modified to run as a local jupyter notebook or local python script by using nbconvert or other similar tools.
